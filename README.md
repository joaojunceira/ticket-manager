Simple app to manage ticketing of Customer Support.
The tickets are opened by someone from a company customer (anyone can open it) support with information about the cause and Customer information, if customer is not in database it should be inserted.

This is just to a task to learn a little bit about Kotlin.

* The feature will be the following:
* Issuing and assignement of tickets to responsible person (Owners);
* Manage of tickets by Managers (the person responsible for the assignment of tickets);

* Send a notification to customer when ticket is solved.
